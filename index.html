                        Located between the valley of Durance and the Gorges of Verdon, the region is home to many fields which produce both lavandin as well as true lavender. To admire the most beautiful fields of lavender in Provence, you can also visit Luberon or the areas surrounding Mont Ventoux, in Pays de Sault.

                        Villefranche is a nice little escape, because there aren't high-rise buildings and ridiculously expensive stores on every corner, like in Monaco and Nice. It has much more of a quaint and relaxing feel to it. ... That being said, it's definitely worth it to spend a day both in Monaco and Nice

                    France, in Western Europe, encompasses medieval cities, alpine villages and Mediterranean beaches. Paris, its capital, is famed for its fashion houses, classical art museums including the Louvre and monuments like the Eiffel Tower. The country is also renowned for its wines and sophisticated cuisine. Lascaux’s ancient cave drawings, Lyon’s Roman theater and the vast Palace of Versailles attest to its rich history
